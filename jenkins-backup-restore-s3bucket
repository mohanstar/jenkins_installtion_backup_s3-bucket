jenkins backup and restore using amazon s3 buckets

-- try to install jenkins on amazon linux (it have aws cli in built)
in other os we should manually install aws cli

-- stop the jenkins 
sudo systemctl stop jenkins

-- zip the jenkins file to upload
tar -zvcf jenkins.tar.gz /var/lib/jenkins

--attach the IAM role of s3 full access to ec2 instance
> go to IAM service create a IAM role by s3 full acess
>go to ec2 and selecte the jenkins insalled instance, click on action and security,modify 
IAM role and add the role which we have created
>go to s3 service, create a s3 bucket with unique name  eg. (jenkins-backup001)
> in instance check s3 access is attached...
aws s3 ls

--copy the jenkins.tar.gz file s3 bucket
aws s3 cp jenkins.tar.gz s3://jenkins-backup001/jenkins.tar.gz

(you can check the uploaded file in s3 server)


--create a new instance and attach the s3 full acess role
--update,install java, aws cli,wget 
--check s3 acess is attached or not by (aws s3 ls)

--now copy the jenkins.tar.gz file from s3 to instance 
aws s3 cp s3://jenkins-backup001/jenkins.tar.gz jenkins.tar.gz

(now the tar file will copy to instance)

--stop jenkins 
sudo systemctl stop jenkins

--delete the jenkins file
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/jenkins

--now install the file inside the .tar
tar -zxvf jenkins.tar.gz -C /

--restart the jenkins 
sudo systemctl start jenkins


check in chrome by ip:8080 (check have you opened the inbound rules or not)
